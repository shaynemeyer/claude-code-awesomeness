# Git Commits

## Trigger

When creating commits or writing commit messages.

## Instructions

- Format: conventional commits type(scope): short description
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf
- Scope: the module or feature area (e.g., auth, api, ui)
- Description: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 chars
- Body (if needed): blank line after subject, wrap at 72 chars, explain WHY not WHAT

## Constraints

- Never use these as commit messages:

"update", "fix", "changes", "misc", "various improvements",

"minor fixes", "WIP"

- Never include file lists in the commit subject line
- If the change touches more than 3 unrelated areas, split it into separate commits

## Example

Bad: Updated user stuff and fixed some bugs

Good: fix(auth): reject expired refresh tokens on renewal
