description: Use this skill when writing or modifying test files in this project. Enforces Vitest as the framework, file-path mirroring (src/x.ts → tests/x.test.ts), describe/it structure, three minimum tests per function, and specific-value assertions over truthiness. paths:
- "\*_/_.test.ts"
- "\*_/_ test.ts"

# Testing Standards

## Trigger

When writing or modifying test files.

##Instructions

- Framework: Vitest (import from 'vitest', not 'jest')
- Test file location: mirror source path src/utils/format.ts → tests/utils/format.test.ts
- Structure: describe() grouped by function, it for each case
- Naming: it(should [expected behavior] when [condition])
- Each function gets minimum 3 tests:

1.  ﻿Happy path with typical input
2.  ﻿Error/edge case (null, empty, boundary values)
3.  ﻿Integration behavior (how it interacts with dependencies)

- Mock external dependencies with vi.mock()
- Never mock the function being tested
- Assert on specific values, not truthiness

Bad: expect(result).toBeTruthy()

Good: expect(result).toBe('validated')

- Use test.each() for parameterized tests with 3+ similar cases

##Constraints

- Do not import from 'jest' or '@jest/globals'
- Do not use snapshot tests unless explicitly asked
- Do not test private functions directly; test them through the public API
